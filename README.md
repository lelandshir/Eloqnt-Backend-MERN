### Packages

- Express: lightweight and fast framework for node.js
- CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing - Express Middleware, so we can access something outside the server, from the server... [more research]
- Mongoose: makes interacting with MongoDB through Node.js simpler
- DOTENV - loads environment vars from .env into process env, simpler dev,
- Nodemon - tool that auto restarts node app/server when file changes are detected
